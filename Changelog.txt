Changelog (7.11.24) Character & Map Update
--Added RayGui stuff into the client.
--Added Face into the player, bodytype, and bodypart.
--Added separate update methods for body and face, still needs to be touched up a bit.
--Added a special case for Character.nx in the ReadNodeData method, it now grabs the appropriate nodes.
--Added a command window, it's going to be used for debugging, changing/adding stuff dynamically, once things get much further.
--Added BodyPart code that encompasses all cases, for now.
--Added BodyType enum
--Added Arm struct to handle the arms of the player
--Added Clear method to Body, Head, Arm classes, to release the textures.
--Added a check where the state doesn't need the face rendered.
--Added random delay to the blinking, it's kind of fast right now, but it works.
--Fixed an issues where the wrong values for the state were being called
--Fixed an animation issue for both MapObjects and the character where the last frame was being skipped.
--Fixed the positioning of all body parts of the player.
--Changed the ActorManager so it only detects actors that can be click on, not all of them.
--Face renders correctly, for now. Had to use an Abs function, which I'm not sure if that's correct.
--Removed Arm, Body, Head classes.
--Removed ResourceManager, not useful right now.
--Removed Obstacle class, not needed right now.

ChangeLog (7.10.24) Experimental Avatar 
-- Added ActorType to differentiate between the different actors
-- Added Body, BodyPart, and Head to handle the creation of the player body for now
-- Added the Player class which encompasses the whole body
-- Added a GetPlayer method to ActorManager
__ Made it so you can see the children in the node, in case you need the names instead of the count.
-- Added a test player to the world class
-- Changed how the world class is initialized so it makes more sense now.
--Fixed an issue with other states that caused the client to crash.
--Fixed an issue with the animation (Player/MapObject) that was iterating correctly.
--Separated the different body rendering for efficiency.

Changelog (7.8.2024) Small changes
-- Removed the IComparable from the Actor class, not point having it there.
-- Changed the actor dictionary to contain a List instead of a sorted set.
-- (Possible Bug) Fixed the sorting, for now. It's hard to say since everything isn't there yet.
-- Added a SortAll List, to sort everything once it's there to reduce sort calls.
-- Fixed the issue with animated objects not being sorted, turns out I didn't even assign the order or layer.

Changelog (7.1.24 - 7.7.24) Rebase
-- Decided to take a different approach.
-- Removed FNA support, amazing library, but lacks the features needed to properly emulate MS.
-- Removed all files, literally.
-- Added Raylib-CSLo
-- Added Networking Support (doesn't use encryption)
-- Added NetworkManager
-- Added ActorManager
-- Added Tile loading
-- Added Object loading
-- Internal structure changes.

-- Added an animated boolean to both MapObject and Background
-- Added a Has method, without the out variable to the NxNode.
-- Added a camera to the world, this will be the primary camera, nothing special yet.
